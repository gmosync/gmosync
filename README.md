I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence and my background is in data science and business analytics.
This summer, my studies are focused on Deep Learning and my professional work is focused on applied AI and MLOps, specifically generative AI and LLMs as a solution for energy industry professionals.
At work, I do advanced analytics for a large energy company, focusing on engineering and process analytics by automating workflows, building data pipelines, and generally making SMEs' lives easier.
