I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence, building on a background in business analytics and data science.

This summer, my studies are focused on Deep Learning, while also exploring applied AI use cases, such as RAG pipelines and other production-grade generative AI solutions.

At work, I do advanced analytics for a large energy company where I focus on engineering process analytics.
