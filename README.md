I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence and my background is in data science and business analytics.
This summer, my studies are focused on Deep Learning and applied AI and MLOps, specifically generative AI and LLMs, plus real-time ML model deployment as solutions for energy industry professionals.
At work, I do advanced analytics for a large energy company, focusing on engineering and process analytics by automating workflows, building data pipelines, and generally making SMEs' lives easier.
