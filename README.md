I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence, building on a background in business analytics and data science.

This summer, my studies are focused on Deep Learning, while also exploring applied AI use cases for work, such as RAG pipelines and other production-grade generative AI solutions.

At work, I do advanced analytics for a large energy company, focusing on engineering process analytics by automating workflows, building data pipelines, and generally making SMEs' lives easier. More recently, I've been focusing on operationalizing continuous ML deployment for uses cases such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis.
